What Brady's Contract Willingness Means to the Bucs
Christian

Anyone remember in February, 2 months ago, when the Bucs were falling in the tank in a 180 nose dive? were suddenly a talentshort team, with a slew of free agents, on the market to trade for the farm for a big name QB? It's amazing what a some an unretirement announcment, player re-signings, and a few under the radar aquisitions can do for a team. Now, going into the draft, the sentiment seems to have done a complete 180 again, and the Bucs now seem the favorites to win the NFC. Everyone seems to have forget the issues we had last year that even sent the whole SuperBowl balloon loosing air to spiral right back to here. Last years draft didn't have much of an immediate impact. We brought the SuperBowl team back, but that wasn't enough, and a non-impact draft won't be enough this year.

27 - Arnold Ebikitie - Edge - Penn State - This guy is being underrated. His pass rush style will translate immediately to the NFL. Statistically and gradewise, he is on par with the top guys in this class. He isn't that big or uber-athletic as Joe Tryon, but Ebikitie has just won aginst some of the better Tackles in college football. Showing he has the speed, enough power, and most importantly already has the great technique, to translate well immediately on the most important down in football. The most glaring deficiency on this defense is the lack of a pass rusher who can consisently win.  While he isn't the freak athlete Joe Tryon is, he is more physically gifted than Shaq Barrett. Don't get me wrong. I love Barrett's game and he seems the perfect player for Ebeketie to continue to hone his craft learning from.  Some may prefer Ojabo or maybe even Drake Jackson from USC, but Ebikitie is the only of those three who could be expected to be a legitimate winner most snaps as a pass rusher, and is even being underrated to some other guys who will get drafted before him. 

2nd - Cole Strange - Left Guard - Chatanooga - There are a plethora of more exciting names that would be awesome to see and I'll outline some other players soon. Cole Strange is a really good player at the Bucs most glaring hole on the O-Line, and personally I think he could be better than Zyon Johnson who a lot of people mock to the Bucs in the first. He's really quick out of his stance and and aware in pass pro. He may never have the power element to his game of Marpet, and maybe losing a power left side exposes Donavon Smith even a bit more, but overall we should even be a better O-Line than we were last year with this pick. 

3rd - Matt Araiza - Punter - Before you Aguayo your coffee onto your computer and scream "A punter in the third! Punt that bs!!". Araize is the best Punter football has ever seen, already. I really don't think Araiza will be still be on the board when we pick in the third, and he could even go earlier. I'm going to punt on on elaborating and refer to the tape, but as to how much of a difference maker he could make.  

4th - Kyle Phillips - This is a true slot receiver in the Julian Edleman mold. Just like Araiza, I think he could well go earlier than this. There are a lot of good WR's in this draft, but for a pure slot, change of direction guy, there are none better. We may not have Chris Godwin to play in the slot to open the season, and even when he comes back, he shouldn't be asked to test dummy across the middle of the field as reward for physicality blocking nearly as much. We now have a lot of guys who can run the whole route tree. Pair that with Brady training up Phillips to run option routes underneath the way he and Bellichik wrote the book on with Welker and Edleman and this offense goes to whole new level attacking all levels of the field. 

5th - Jerome Ford - RB - Cincinatti - 

6th - Cole Turner - TE - Nevada  

7th - Jarrid Williams - OT - Miami - Looks athletic in his picture. We could really use legitamate offensive tackle depth.
