yodub

I am many things, but I  haven't been what I want to be defined as yet. Ever since I started this work, I wanted to do something special with it. To me, it was

and I tend towards the more extreme in the things I am

I've spent my life with my head buried in the sand silicon of a screen. I've always felt like I have a lot to share, but haven't been able to send it or share enough yet. I guess I can tend to overcomplicate things. Things in this world, in my world, are complicated, but that's not an excuse for me anymore.

When I was a kid, I thought about being an actor, but I was scared to go off alone to a different school than my friends, and scared to be judged as not good enough, to audition and be rejected. What I didn't realize until now, 25 years later, is that being judged, and being rejected is true in any part of life, how true Shakespeare's "All the worldâ€™s a stage, And all the men and women merely players" is. I also didn't realize that if I would have gone alone from my friends, that I probably would have found more alike, better, friends, that we're all alone to one level or another, but it's what we do alone for ourselves, that will most shape us and all of our relationships. 

"Everything is as it should be" though. I'm different than I was then, then I was yesterday, and I'll be different tomorrow. I'm ready to audition what I got to the world, on my own terms this time, focusing on what I'm good at. This is going to be my personal blog, and where I share what I want to about whatever I want to. My other projects will try not to use the word "I," but I am dub, so yodub.
